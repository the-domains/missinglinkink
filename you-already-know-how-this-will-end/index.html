<p>I've been staring at this space to type out my post for a good 3-4 hours. I'm not sure what to write... or how to write it, I just know that I feel I have to say something to fill the silence... and maybe to help understand it.</p><p>Also, I'd like to post something to say he was here... something that will mark a space for him... something that will tell a part of his story - the worst part - so that maybe others don't have to go there and can get help. Or maybe so that people can see the reality of it. </p><p>I don't know. </p><p>For now I'll start with copying an email I had sent to a friend in an attempt to explain the situation because I'm having a hard time coming up with new words.</p><p>My cousin died on the 26th of March, 2015. He was 35. I found out that night when I got home. My sister called me to let me know. The details are a bit jumbled as we go the info as it came in from my aunts and I never really knew how to ask for full details.</p><p>It was a bit brutal... I haven't read more of the news coverage on it... I'm afraid to as they never had all the details. I do know that it was a suicide attempt... and then he was shot. Apparently he had a knife and my aunt was trying to stop him... he had locked himself in his room so she called the police to help... they got there and went to his room, he opened the door and attacked them, so they shot him. </p><p>They say that he had already sliced his throat, though... and I still don't understand it. The grief/knowledge comes in waves.</p><p>My mom said that he had had a bad week and had just wanted the voices to stop. You see, he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia about... 10 -15 years ago, I believe. Maybe longer... the years kind of blur.</p><p>My guess is that he knew what he was doing when he went for the officers, especially considering that, if they went in to find him with his throat slit but still savable, they'd likely try to stop him. So why not attack, knowing full well they'd have to shoot him? I feel for the officer or officers that had to shoot and I hope people don't blame him/them.</p><p>I can't help but think, though... and I hate to say it because it does sound so cliché... but he's better off, maybe? In a better place... even if that's no place? He was just this broken boy... who had to live with his parents because he was mentally ill... and pretty badly.</p><p>I can talk about it… I mean… let’s not ignore the elephant in the room. Still, I can’t fully explain it without breaking down sometimes.</p><p>Living with my own mental illness can be tough and I can't imagine how tough it was for my cousin. Apparently it was unbearable... and I can see that, can see why he did it. Maybe people will think that this is horrible to say, but I can see the why of it. It's sad and disturbing that it happens, and maybe if he had the right meds/help/diagnosis (if in fact he didn't), he'd have been better when he was alive. </p><p>Then again, maybe not. </p><p><a>SAARDA - Schizophrenia and Related Disorders Alliance of America</a></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">You Already Know How This Will End</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
